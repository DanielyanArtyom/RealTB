                                    Just as the Moon’s history was disrobed by laser ranging 50 years ago, Earth’s
                                    tropical
                                    forests are giving up their secrets to the light. Airborne light detection and
                                    ranging—called LiDAR—has over the last ten years become a key tool that ecologists
                                    use
                                    to understand physical variation in tropical forests across space and time. Like an
                                    MRI
                                    of the human brain, LiDAR probes the intricate three-dimensional architecture of the
                                    forest canopy, unveiling carbon that forests keep out of the atmosphere, and also
                                    the
                                    mounting threats to that carbon storehouse: drought, fire, clandestine logging and
                                    brash
                                    gold-mining operations. Even the quintessential natural disturbance of the
                                    sun-filled
                                    light gap—long thought to enhance the incredibly high species diversity of tropical
                                    forests—has been deconstructed by laser technology. Laser ranging in tropical
                                    forests is
                                    such a game-changing technology that science results can scarcely get through
                                    peer-review before they are dwarfed by still larger-scale studies. In a decade,
                                    laser
                                    power on commercial-grade LiDARs has skyrocketed and costs have plummeted. These
                                    improvements in LiDAR technology allow airplanes to fly faster, higher and farther,
                                    covering more forest area in a single day than every ground-based survey that has
                                    ever
                                    been collected in the history of tropical ecology. To estimate the amount of carbon
                                    stored in a 50-hectare tropical forest monitoring plot on the ground—the largest
                                    field
                                    plot in the world—takes a team of 12 people about eight months: a slog of rain and
                                    mud
                                    and snakes with tape measures and data log books. Today’s airborne LiDARs can get
                                    you to
                                    within about 10% of the same carbon estimate in eight seconds. It is this staggering
                                    contrast in scale between LiDAR and fieldwork that led us here: Before this decade
                                    is
                                    out, we could directly assess the carbon stock of every single square hectare of
                                    tropical forest on Earth. We could do it just as well as if we were standing there
                                    in
                                    the flesh with tape measures in hand. And we could do it for far less than what we
                                    have
                                    already spent to offset carbon emissions from forests. . . . It is easy in
                                    principle,
                                    though logistically nightmarish, to measure carbon in tropical forests. A strict
                                    constructionist would cut, dry and weigh the biomass of the world’s forests. But
                                    this is
                                    a self-defeating enterprise. As a result, it is likely that no one has measured
                                    carbon
                                    over a single hectare of tropical forest, even with the most detailed field surveys.
                                    For
                                    a century ecologists and foresters have relied on allometric1 estimation in lieu of
                                    carbon measurements to translate field surveys of tree diameters, heights and wood
                                    densities into whole-forest carbon estimates. Given a volume with known dimensions
                                    and
                                    density, one would estimate its mass in a similar fashion. As the new kid on the
                                    block,
                                    LiDAR has been tacked onto the back end—initially thought of as kind of large-scale
                                    helper to field surveys. Carbon estimates from the field have been treated as
                                    something
                                    inherently closer to the real thing than measurements made by LiDAR—ground “Truth”
                                    with
                                    a capital “T”. This is perhaps understandable historically, but vis-à-vis actual
                                    carbon,
                                    there is no such thing as ground truth: both field and LiDAR efforts rely on
                                    allometry
                                    to convert measurements into carbon estimates. Prior to using these measurements for
                                    carbon estimation, they exist as standardized, spatially explicit, archivable and
                                    verifiable data—the needed substrate for a REDD2-type accounting program. Due to the
                                    constancy of the underlying measurements, both field and LiDAR data could provide
                                    the
                                    needed information if they covered every hectare on Earth. But, in the case of field
                                    surveys, this is impossible. The surveys that do exist measure a tiny amount of
                                    actual
                                    forest, and so what might be verified is widely spaced. And to avoid fraud and
                                    protect
                                    landowners, many governments keep their plot locations secret. Satellite LiDAR data
                                    remain sparse, providing only extrapolated, coarse-resolution carbon estimates with
                                    very
                                    high uncertainties, and there is no prospect of wall-to-wall coverage in the near
                                    future. By 2020, airborne LiDAR could give us a direct measurement of 3-D forest
                                    structure for every hectare in the tropics: a standardized database from which to
                                    build
                                    a carbon economy. Beginning of reading passage footnotes. 1 Pertaining to the study
